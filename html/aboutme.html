                        <p class="italics">
                            I've played the piano since I was eight and have played consistently up through high school.  
                            I've mostly played classic music, including Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, and Chopin.  Chopin is my favorite
                            composer.  The video above is a performance of Chopin's Fantaisie Impromptu.  This video was taken while I was on a 
                            two-year mission in the greater Seattle area around Christmastime 2020.  Because of the wariness of COVID, the 
                            church congregation couldn't have their annual Christmas party in person.  One of the members put together a 
                            virtual Christmas party collection of performances.  When he found out that I could play the piano, he recorded 
                            this video of me.
                        </p>

                        <p class="italics">
                            I have a total of five members in my immediate family, including an older brother and an older sister.  My parents 
                            are from the Tokyo area.  Their first experience in the US was when my dad went to BYU-Hawaii.  After he got his 
                            bachelors degree, he went to Pittsburgh to get his masters and PhD in IT.  I was born in Pittsburgh, but I call 
                            Kentucky my home, which was where my dad was a professor.  Right after I graduated high school, my family moved to 
                            Rexburg, ID.  My parents were empty nesters at that point, and they lived there for four years.  They are currently 
                            living on the Micronesian islands serving as mission president and companion and started their time there in June 2022.  
                            They will be there for three years.

                        <p class="italics">
                            My brother got his bachelors and masters degrees at Brigham Young University in computer science.  
                            He then went to the University at Buffalo to get his PhD in classical studies in Latin and 
                            Greek.   He's now a data engineer at The Hartford.  His wife is a high school Latin teacher.

                        <p class="italics">
                            My sister works at a clothing factory where she makes customized clothes, blankets, and accessories for 
                            babies.  Her husband works as a data analyst.  They are expecting their first child in December.
